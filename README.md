# mtr-en2th

mtr-en2th is a project that uses transforms to perform machine translation of English song lyrics to Thai. This project can be useful for anyone who wants to understand the meaning of English songs in Thai, or for language learners who want to improve their English and Thai skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with mtr-en2th, you will need to build a virtual environment using venv. This will ensure that you have a clean and isolated environment to work with, and that all of the necessary dependencies are installed correctly.

To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

This will create a new directory called env that contains all of the necessary files for your virtual environment.

Next, activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
This will activate the virtual environment and allow you to install the required dependencies.

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the required dependencies using pip. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the necessary dependencies for mtr-en2th.

Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will begin the training process for the machine translation model. During the training process, the model will learn how to translate English song lyrics to Thai. Once the training process is complete, you will be able to use the model to translate any English song lyrics to Thai.
